# Web Development Practice for Web Penetration Testing

This repository contains a basic web development project built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The project is part of my personal journey to understand how web technologies work at their core. 

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to build a strong foundation in web development to understand how websites are structured and interact. By learning these fundamentals, I aim to improve my skills in **Web Penetration Testing (Web PenTest)**. Understanding the structure and functioning of websites is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities and potential security risks, which are key for testing and securing web applications.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: To structure the content of the web pages.
- **CSS**: To style and design the pages.
- **JavaScript**: To add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the website.

## Why This Project?

As part of my learning process, this project helps me:
- Gain hands-on experience with core front-end technologies.
- Build an understanding of how websites are constructed.
- Learn how to spot potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited in penetration testing.
